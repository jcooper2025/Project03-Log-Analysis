# Project03-Log-Analysis
Code for the third project in the Full Stack Nanodegree program from Udacity.

# Purpose and Overview

This program is to fulfill the requirements for the third project in the Udacity Fullstack Nanodegree.
The function of the program is to simulate a report generating script that pulls a static set of information from the execution logs and article database for an online website.
The information gathered will be for 3 static and pre-determined questions. These were set in the original project specfication and the queries are hardcoded in the script itself. At this time there is no capability to generate reports of different combinations without changing the code itself.
The questions answered are:
1. What are the most popular articles of all time? Which articles have been accessed the most. Present this information as a sorted list with the most popular at the top.
2. Who are the most popular article authors of all time? That is when you sum up all of the articles each author has written, which authors get the most page views? Present this as a sorted list with the most popular author at the top.
3. On which days did more than 1% of requests lead to errors? The log table includes a column status that indicates the HTTP status code that the news site sent to the user's browser.
